<p><strong>Background:</strong> A <u>user</u> downloads and installs a <u>system</u> of program files, mostly ado-files, which form the foundation of most of the commands used in Stata Programming. Using those commands and additional syntax written out sequentially in a do-file, the user creates well-formed instruction to Stata called a do-file script. Once the user runs this script, results are generated and displayed in the results window, in a graph, or in a format (<code>.xlsx</code>, <code>.log</code>, <code>.dta</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.md</code>, <code>LaTeX</code>, <code>.html</code>, etc). The <code>.html</code> file format is of specific interest since its the pathway to self-publication. To illustrate how this may be achieved in Stata, we hereby introduce the <code>dyndoc</code> command.</p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong> We created a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhustata/livre/main/filename.do">do-file</a> and populated it with this abstract using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> language. Anything in this document that is not ordinary text including <code>&lt;&lt;dd_version: 2&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;dd_do:nooutput&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;/dd_do&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;dd_display: c(N)&gt;&gt;</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language#:~:text=A%20markup%20language%20is%20a,content%20to%20facilitate%20automated%20processing.">markup</a>. Input &amp; output that might be numeric, string, alphanumeric, or formatted as macros are embeded at these markedup points. We then saved this document using the file extension .do; however, any text file extension will work (.txt, .md, .do, etc). To the <code>pwd</code> where we saved this text file, we added a cascading style sheet <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhustata/livre/main/stmarkdown.css">stmarkdown.css</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhustata/livre/main/header.txt">header.txt</a> to enhance the aesthetic of our .html file. Finally, we typed the following command into the Stata command window:   <code>dyndoc index.do, saving(index.html) replace</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> We identified the newly created .html file in our directory and opened it to compare its format to this markdown file. And we saw all that we had made, and behold, it was very good. Ghastly macros in the original markdown language were now rendered as neatly formatted results. There were  30 observations and 2 variables in the simulated dataset. The histogram of age ($\text{Age, years} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=57,,\sigma^{2}=225)$) demonstrated the distribution of age in two hypothetical populations under normal distribution and t-distribution, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> In walking you through syntax, do-file creation, queued commands, generated results, through to embedding neatly formatted output in .html, we believe you now have a sense of what that Stata might offer you. These ideas can be generalized to embedding results in .xlsx, .log, .dta, .docx, etc.</p>
